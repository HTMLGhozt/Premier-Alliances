export const historyText = `<p>
    Premier Alliances, Inc. has been serving and supporting the communities of Cochise County and the
    surrounding areas since 1962. Originally founded in Bisbee by concerned community members as a
    means to provide educational opportunities to children with developmental disabilities, the program
    grew, serving both adults and children with disabilities through educational and vocational
    programs, becoming the Cochise County Association for the Handicapped in 1975. In 1995,
    CCAH won the groundskeeping contract for Fort Huachuca and was later renamed. Today,
    Premier Alliances continues to provide gainful employment and life skills development opportunities
    for a historically underserved population, both on the Fort Huachuca Army Installation, where we
    also maintain the historic Old Post Cemetery, at the Brian A. Terry Border Patrol Station near
    Bisbee, where our employees provide custodial services, and at the Print and Stitch custom printing
    and embroidery shop in Bisbee.
  </p>
  <p>
    Premier Alliances, Inc. secures federal contracts reserved for the disabled workforce by the
    AbilityOne Program through our partnership with the SourceAmerica national nonprofit network,
    while continuing to look for ways to expand our services through local enterprises, which result
    in more opportunities for the population we serve.
  </p>
  <hr />
  <p>
    Beyond our services to our employees, Premier Alliances, Inc. believes that community outreach
    and partnerships are the most effective ways to create a community that is inclusive and full of
    opportunities, not obstacles, for people with disabilities. We continuously look for ways to work
    closely with local governments, private businesses, our nonprofit partners and other service
    organizations on projects, events, activities and programs which align with our mission,
    “Improving the lives of people with disabilities.”
